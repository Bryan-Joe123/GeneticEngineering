                <!-- Genetic engineering is a field of biotechnology that involves manipulating the 
                genetic material <span class="white">(DNA)</span> of organisms to alter their traits or characteristics. 
                It allows scientists to introduce or modify specific genes in an organism's genome, 
                leading to changes in its <span class="white">phenotype</span> (observable traits) or function. This process can 
                have applications in various areas, including agriculture, medicine, and industry, with 
                the aim of improving crop yields, developing <span class="white">new treatments for diseases</span>, or creating 
                novel biological products. -->

                The artificial <span class="white">manipulation</span>, <span class="white">modification</span>, and <span class="white">recombination</span> of <span class="white">DNA</span> or other nucleic acid
                molecules in order to modify an organism or population of organisms. The term <span class="white">genetic engineering</span> 
                is generally used to refer to methods of recombinant <span class="white">DNA</span> technology, which
                emerged from basic research in microbial genetics. <br><br> The techniques employed in genetic 
                engineering have led to the production of medically important products, including 
                <span class="white">human insulin</span>, <span class="white">human growth hormone</span>, and <span class="white">hepatitis B vaccine</span>, as well as to the development
                of genetically modified organisms such as <span class="white">disease-resistant plants</span>.
