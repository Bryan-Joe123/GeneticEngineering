    <p>
        Health care has been in development for the past melenium but never as much as right now, people are <span class="key">living longer</span> that ever before and the death rate has been steadly reducing and the population has grown <span class="key">10x</span> compared to couple decades ago. <span class="key">vaccines</span> played an important role in curing deseases in the past and now, but now according to scientist <span class="key">genetic engineering</span> will be the most <span class="key">sufisticated</span> and <span class="key">advanced</span> teconology in the feild of <span class="key">healthcare</span> and biology till now. If fully developed it has the ebility to change human lives for ever.
        <br><br>

        In medicine, genetic engineering has been used to <span class="key">mass-produce insulin, human growth hormones, follistim (for treating infertility), human albumin, monoclonal antibodies, antihemophilic factors, vaccines, and many other drugs</span>. In research, organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes.

        This is help enhance the felid of Health care to its highest.

    <h1  >CRISPR-Cas9 <span class="sub-sub-heading">the game changer</span></h1> 
    <p>
        Imagine we lived in the <span class="key">1980s</span> and were told that computers would take over the world, that computers would handle pretty much every thing from shopping, dating and the stock market and we would have a have a hand held device orders of magnitude more powerful that the super computers of that time. It seems impossible, but it became reality and became <span class="key">normal</span> we don't even think about it.
        <br><br>
        We are in a similar stage with <span class="key">genetic engineering</span> now, The new technology <span class="key">CRISPR</span> (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has the ability to change what we pensive as normal for ever.
        <br><br>
        It has a wide spread application in <span class="key">healthcare</span> in curing deceases and fight cancer. In 2015, scientist used CRISPR to cut HIV virus out of the living cell out of a patients in a lab. Simply just an year later a larger scape project was held with rats with <span class="key">HIV</span> present in <span class="key">99%</span> of their cells. After injecting CRISPR in the rat's tails, they were able to remove over <span class="key">50%</span> of the virus from the rat's body. In future it may be possible to completely cure <span class="key">HIV</span> for good.

        <span class="key">The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change (mutation?) into the DNA. These are:</span>
    </p>   
    <ol>
        <li>an enzyme? called Cas9. This acts as a pair of ‘molecular scissors’ that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed.</li>
        <li>A piece of RNA? called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence (about 20 bases long) located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence ‘guides’ Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    <br>
    The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases? that are complementary? to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.
    <br><br>
    The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.
    <br><br>
    At this stage the cell? recognises that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.
    <br><br>
    Scientists can use the DNA repair machinery to introduce changes to one or more genes? in the genome of a cell of interest.
