    <h1>Genetic Engineering <span class="sub-sub-heading">in Healthcare</span></h1> 
    <p>
        Health care has been in development for the past melenium but never as much as right now, people are <span class="key">living longer</span> that ever before and the death rate has been steadly reducing and the population has grown <span class="key">10x</span> compared to couple decades ago. <span class="key">vaccines</span> played an important role in curing deseases in the past and now, but now according to scientist <span class="key">genetic engineering</span> will be the most <span class="key">sufisticated</span> and <span class="key">advanced</span> teconology in the feild of <span class="key">healthcare</span> and biology till now. If fully developed it has the ebility to change human lives for ever.
        <br><br>

        In medicine, genetic engineering has been used to <span class="key">mass-produce insulin, human growth hormones, follistim (for treating infertility), human albumin, monoclonal antibodies, antihemophilic factors, vaccines, and many other drugs</span>. In research, organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes.

        This is help enhance the feild of Health care to its heightest.
