                <p>
                    Health care has been in development for the past melenium but never as much as right now, people are <span class="key">living longer</span> that ever before and the death rate has been steadily reducing and the population has grown <span class="key">10x</span> compared to couple decades ago. <span class="key">vaccines</span> played an important role in curing deceases in the past and now, but now according to scientist <span class="key">genetic engineering</span> will be the most <span class="key">sophisticated</span> and <span class="key">advanced</span> technology in the felid of <span class="key">healthcare</span> and biology till now. If fully developed it has the ability to change human lives for ever.
                    <br><br>

                    In medicine, genetic engineering has been used to <span class="key">mass-produce insulin, human growth hormones, follistim (for treating infertility), human albumin, monoclonal antibodies, antihemophilic factors, vaccines, and many other drugs</span>. In research, organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes.

                    This is help enhance the felid of Health care to its highest.

                    <span class="key">1. It can cure genetic deceases</span><br>
                    IIt can cure genetic deceases that cannon be cured with traditional medicines as they pass on through generations<br>
                    <span class="key">2. Production of edible vaccines</span><br>
                    Edible vaccines will be available which contains bacteria which are genetically modified to fight a specific type of virus. This is highly effective as they can spot the virus more accurately even if they are hiding among other cells. <br>
                    <span class="key">3. Cure for Cancer</span><br>
                    Cancer an disease that is one of our main rivals, treating it has been an challenge until now. Genetically modified killer T-cells and other immune cells are produced and is being injected into the human body. Which are more active cancer finders and hunters. This has been under development for the past few decades, and is being developed faster than ever before.<br>
                    <span class="key">4. Develop GMO crops</span><br>
                    A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an animal, plant, or microbe whose DNA has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. For thousands of years, humans have used breeding methods to modify organisms. Corn, cattle, and even dogs have been selectively bred over generations to have certain desired traits.<br>
                    <span class="key">5. Gene therapy</span><br>
                    Gene therapy is a technique that uses a gene(s) to treat, prevent or cure a disease or medical disorder. Often, gene therapy works by adding new copies of a gene that is broken, or by replacing a defective or missing gene in a patient's cells with a healthy version of that gene.<br>
                    <span class="key">5. Cloning</span><br>
                    Cloning is a technique scientists use to make exact genetic copies of living things. Genes, cells, tissues, and even whole animals can all be cloned. Some clones already exist in nature. Single-celled organisms like bacteria make exact copies of themselves each time they reproduce. This approach, by avoiding risk of rejection by the immune system, has the potential to benefit many patients, including those affected by Alzheimer disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injury.<br>

                    There is always a risk regarding the uncertainty involved. There is always a chance of gene edit being a failing and creating unintended edits. But now days genetic engineering is getting way more precise and accurate, with no need to worry about mistakes.<br>

                    Imagine we lived in the <span class="key">1980s</span> and were told that computers would take over the world, that computers would handle pretty much every thing from shopping, dating and the stock market and we would have a have a hand held device orders of magnitude more powerful that the super computers of that time.

                    <br><br>
                    We are in a similar stage with <span class="key">genetic engineering</span> now, The new technology <span class="key">CRISPR</span> (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has the ability to change what we pensive as normal for ever. Soon we will be able to engineer babies with selected traits like smartness and strength on our will. It will be so consistent that it will me normal and there will be no risks involved. Future athletic champions will for sure be genetically modifies in some way to help them play better in their games.

                <p>
                    It has a wide spread application in <span class="key">healthcare</span> in curing deceases and fight cancer. In 2015, scientist used CRISPR to cut HIV virus out of the living cell out of a patients in a lab. Simply just an year later a larger scape project was held with rats with <span class="key">HIV</span> present in <span class="key">99%</span> of their cells. After injecting CRISPR in the rat's tails, they were able to remove over <span class="key">50%</span> of the virus from the rat's body. In future it may be possible to completely cure <span class="key">HIV</span> for good.

                    <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                        <ol>
                            <li>an enzyme? called Cas9. This acts as a pair of 'molecular scissors' that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed.</li>
                            <li>A piece of RNA? called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence (about 20 bases long) located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence 'guides' Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                <br>
                The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases? that are complementary? to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.
                <br><br>
                The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.
                <br><br>
                At this stage the cell? recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.
                <br><br>
                Scientists can use the DNA repair machinery to introduce changes to one or more genes? in the genome of a cell of interest.
