                Imagine we lived in the <span class="key">1980s</span> and were told that computers would take over the world, that computers would handle pretty much every thing from shopping, dating and the stock market and we would have a have a hand held device orders of magnitude more powerful that the super computers of that time. It seems impossible, but it became reality and became <span class="key">normal</span> we don't even think about it.
                <br><br>
                We are in a similar stage with <span class="key">genetic engineering</span> now, The new technology <span class="key">CRISPR</span> (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has the ability to change what we pensive as normal for ever. Soon we will be able to engineer babies with selected traits like smartness and strength on our will. It will be so consistent that it will me normal and there will be no risks involved. Future athletic champions will for sure be genetically modifies in some way to help them play better in their games.
