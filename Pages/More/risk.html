                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Genetic engineering raises ethical questions about playing with the fundamental building blocks of life. There are concerns about the unintended consequences of manipulating genes and creating organisms with specific traits, potentially leading to unforeseen negative impacts on ecosystems or the organisms themselves.

                <span class="key">2. Unintended Consequences</span>
                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Genetic modifications can have unintended effects on an organism's physiology, behavior, or interactions with its environment. These unintended consequences might not become apparent until after the modified organisms are released into the wild or used extensively in agriculture.

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    There are concerns about the potential health risks associated with consuming genetically modified foods. While regulatory bodies generally approve GMOs for consumption, long-term effects on human health are still a subject of ongoing research and debate.

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Pests and pathogens could potentially evolve and develop resistance to genetically modified crops designed to resist them. This could lead to the emergence of superbugs or superweeds that are difficult to control and could have broader ecological implications.

                <span class="key">5. Unpredictable Gene Flow</span>
                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Genes from genetically modified organisms can potentially spread to wild relatives through crossbreeding, leading to unintended genetic changes in natural populations. This gene flow could have ecological and evolutionary consequences.

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Genetic engineering could exacerbate socio-economic inequalities. If certain genetically modified crops or technologies become dominant, traditional agricultural practices and local knowledge might be devalued, impacting the livelihoods of local communities.

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Developing and enforcing regulations for genetic engineering can be complex and challenging. Ensuring that GMOs are safe for both human health and the environment requires robust oversight and testing procedures.

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Genetic engineering could introduce new allergens or increase the allergenic potential of certain foods. This could pose risks to individuals with allergies who consume genetically modified products unknowingly.
