                <h2>Cloning (Dolly)</h2>
                <p>Dolly was important because she was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. Her birth proved that specialised cells could be used to create an exact copy of the animal they came from.</p>

                <p>Dolly started her life as a single cell in a test tube taken from the mammary gland of a Finn Dorset sheep and an egg cell from a Scottish Blackface Sheep. Once normal development was confirmed in a lab at six days, the embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother. Dolly was then born on 5 July 1996 and named after the country western singer Dolly Parton.</p>

                <h2>Wild Tomatoes</h2>
                <p>The tomato’s path from wild plant to household staple is much more complex than researchers have long thought. For many years, scientists believed that humans domesticated the tomato in two major phases. First, native people in South America cultivated blueberry-sized wild tomatoes about 7,000 years ago to breed a plant with a cherry-sized fruit. Later, people in Mesoamerica bred this intermediate group further to form the large cultivated tomatoes that we eat today.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This research has direct implications for crop improvement. For example, some intermediate tomato groups have high levels of glucose, which makes the fruit sweeter. Breeders could use those plants to make cultivated tomatoes more attractive to consumers.</p>

                    Golden Rice is an enhanced version of ordinary rice designed to handle a specific nutrition issue, without any additional cost or difference in taste.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, there is no cultivation or commercialisation of Golden Rice in India. However, a version of Golden Rice, called GR2E1 has got the necessary approvals related to its regulatory clearance in the Philippines and it is being cultivated in huge areas in that country.
