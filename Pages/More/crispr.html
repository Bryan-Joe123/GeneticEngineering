            <p>
                It has a wide spread application in <span class="key">healthcare</span> in curing diseases and fight cancer. In 2015, scientist used CRISPR to cut HIV virus out of the living cell out of a patients in a lab. Simply just an year later a larger scale project was held with rats with <span class="key">HIV</span> present in <span class="key">99%</span> of their cells. After injecting CRISPR in the rat's tails, they were able to remove over <span class="key">50%</span> of the virus from the rat's body. In future it may be possible to completely cure <span class="key">HIV</span> for good.

                <span class="key">The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce a change (mutation?) into the DNA. These are:</span>
                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    an enzyme? called Cas9. This acts as a pair of 'molecular scissors' that can cut the two strands of DNA at a specific location in the genome so that bits of DNA can then be added or removed. <br><br>
                    A piece of RNA? called guide RNA (gRNA). This consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence (about 20 bases long) located within a longer RNA scaffold. The scaffold part binds to DNA and the pre-designed sequence 'guides' Cas9 to the right part of the genome. This makes sure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome.

            <p>
            <br>
            The guide RNA is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The guide RNA has RNA bases? that are complementary? to those of the target DNA sequence in the genome. This means that, at least in theory, the guide RNA will only bind to the target sequence and no other regions of the genome.
            <br><br>
            The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a cut across both strands of the DNA.
