                    Cancer an disease that is one of our main rivals, treating it has been an challenge until now. Genetically modified killer T-cells and other immune cells are produced and is being injected into the human body. Which are more active cancer finders and hunters. This has been under development for the past few decades, and is being developed faster than ever before.<br>

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an animal, plant, or microbe whose DNA has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. For thousands of years, humans have used breeding methods to modify organisms. Corn, cattle, and even dogs have been selectively bred over generations to have certain desired traits.<br>

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Gene therapy is a technique that uses a gene(s) to treat, prevent or cure a disease or medical disorder. Often, gene therapy works by adding new copies of a gene that is broken, or by replacing a defective or missing gene in a patient's cells with a healthy version of that gene.<br>

                <div class="more-dropdown-content">
                    Cloning is a technique scientists use to make exact genetic copies of living things. Genes, cells, tissues, and even whole animals can all be cloned. Some clones already exist in nature. Single-celled organisms like bacteria make exact copies of themselves each time they reproduce. This approach, by avoiding risk of rejection by the immune system, has the potential to benefit many patients, including those affected by Alzheimer disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injury.<br>
