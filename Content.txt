Human Gene Bank

A human gene bank collects, stores, and preserves genetic material from individuals for research and medical purposes, enabling researchers to study disease genetics and develop personalized medicine approaches.

Human Genome Bank
The Human Genome Bank is a collection of DNA samples from voluntary donors, preserving genetic diversity for scientific research. It aids in understanding human evolution, population migration, and genetic diversity, while ensuring donor confidentiality and privacy.


Genetic in Organ Transplants

Genetics significantly impacts organ transplantation, affecting compatibility, risk of rejection, effectiveness of immunosuppressive treatments, and long-term outcomes. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing compatibility assessment, minimizing rejection risks, tailoring treatments, and enhancing patient care.

Gene Manipulation Before Birth 
Genetically altered embryos can be achieved by introducing the desired genetic material into the embryo itself, or into the sperm and/or egg cells of the parents; either by delivering the desired genes directly into the cell or using gene-editing technology.
